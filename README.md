## React
## Some React programms
- 1) Change the color of one particular "li" that was selected (Pro_1.js)
- 2) Fragments:
  - Components that return multiple elements (Pro_2.js)
  - Conditionally rendering elements. They make rendering groups of elements a lot easier without adding extra markup.
  - Arrays. Fragments can also help us when rendering arrays, because fragments can have key props! Let’s say you have an array of user objects and you want to render all users from the array. You need to set key prop for every user so you would need to use element like div to wrap the user info. But because fragments can have key prop, you can instead use fragments and give the key prop for them and thus you don’t need to introduce any extra markup.
